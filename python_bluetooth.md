# Python Bluetooth
There are many resources invloving Bluetooth and Python that choosing one over the other can be hard.
I decided to go with bluepy because of the community and documentation.
Some of the resources I came across during my research are -
- PyBlueZ
- Blue Zero
- PyGATT
- Bleak
- BLE Suite
- PyBT
- Adafruit Python Bluefriuit LE
- 

Other tools (not necessarily python based) -
* bettercap
- Bleah
- hcitool, hciconfig, hcidump
- sdptool
- l2ping
- udigen
