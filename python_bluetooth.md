# Python Bluetooth
There are many resources invloving Bluetooth and Python that choosing one over the other can be hard.
I decided to go with bluepy because of the community and documentation.
Some of the resources I came across during my research are -
- PyBlueZ
- Blue Zero
- PyGATT
- Bleak
- BLE Suite
- PyBT
- Adafruit Python Bluefriuit LE

Other tools (not necessarily python based) -
- bettercap
- Bleah
- hcitool, hciconfig, hcidump
- sdptool
- l2ping
- udigen

**Check out and run the examples from the [sample code](https://github.com/armsp/nano-33-ble-gen/tree/master/bluetooth/python_bluetooth)**  

Here is a recording of getting real time accelerometer data via bluetooth by subscribing to notifications (this is the [bluetooth_peripheral.py](https://github.com/armsp/nano-33-ble-gen/blob/master/bluetooth/python_bluetooth/bluetooth_peripheral.py) example) -
