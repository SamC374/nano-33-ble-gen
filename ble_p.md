### BLE Experiments
Testing the bluetooth connection is simple enough. We will use the inbuilt the Peripheral Examples from [this library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE) that you can install via the [Library manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries#toc3). You can install the [nRF Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) App for the connection.
